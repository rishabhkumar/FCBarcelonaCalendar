# FCBarcelonaCalendar
This app was created by me when I was still new to Android. So, it obviously has some issues, such as: it won't check for your connectivity with the Internet.

<b> But what it does? </b>
<p>First of all, I am a Barcelona Fan. So, naturally, I would want to create an app for it. So this app fetches all the remaining fixtures from the Internet and brings that straight to your phone!
